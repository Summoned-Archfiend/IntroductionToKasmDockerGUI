# Docker Installation

Kasm is no different from any other program. You can see how easy it was to install
Kasm on a remote server like Linode. We can even spin up a Kasm container directly on our local machine using Docker. You can do this either manually by firing up an Ubuntu
container and then installing Kasm, this is not the recommended route, as what is the point in containers within containers?

Or you can pull from Kasms [official images](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=kasm)
on the docker hub to spin up specific containers for your needs.
